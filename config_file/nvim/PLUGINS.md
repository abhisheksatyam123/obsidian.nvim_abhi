# Neovim Plugin Documentation 🚀

This document explains the purpose and key features of the currently active plugins installed in your Neovim configuration (`~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/`).

## 🎨 UI & Aesthetics

- **Catppuccin** (`catppuccin.lua`): A soothing, high-contrast color scheme. Set as the default theme.
- **Lualine** (`lualine.lua`): A fast and highly customizable statusline at the bottom of the editor. Shows file information, encoding, and your location.
- **Indent-Blankline** (`indent-blankline.lua`): Adds subtle vertical guides to indicate code indentation levels, making it easier to read deeply nested code.
- **Highlight-Colors** (`highlight-colors.lua` - *Interesting Words*): Allows you to highlight specific words in different colors to track them. Keys: `\` to search/highlight, `<leader>k` to toggle.
- **Which-Key** (`which-key.lua`): A popup bridge that helps you remember your keybindings. When you press a leader key, it shows you all available follow-up commands.

  - `<leader>ff`: Find files
  - `<leader>fg`: Live grep
  - `<leader>fb`: Buffers
- **Telescope** (`telescope.lua`): A highly extensible fuzzy finder. Mostly acts as a dependency/UI selector for other plugins (like Harpoon, Todo-Comments).

  - **Mason**: A manager for LSP servers, formatters, and linters.
  - **LSP-Config**: Connects Neovim to these servers for features like "Go to Definition" (`gd`), "Hover info" (`K`), and "Code Actions" (`ca`).
- **Completions** (`completions.lua` - *nvim-cmp*): Provides the auto-completion popup as you type, pulling suggestions from LSP, snippets (LuaSnip), and the buffer.

  - `]c` / `[c`: Jump to next/previous hunk.
